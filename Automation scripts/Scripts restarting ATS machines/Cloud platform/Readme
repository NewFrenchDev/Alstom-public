Script can be recovered here if lost:

This script is used on TCC1 or TCC2 (Workstation/VM corresponding to the HMI)

You need also to put the script in the path said in it (script_path).
If you don't want to put in the default path I wrote, you can change it with the path where you want to put it on the network.

IMPORTANT: The path needs to be accessible by all VMs!
